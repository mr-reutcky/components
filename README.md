# Components

This project is a modular collection of React components designed for building clean, responsive, and reusable user interfaces. It serves as a personal learning and demonstration space for creating consistent UI elements and layouts using React and SCSS.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each UI element is isolated into its own component for clarity and reusability.
- **SCSS Styling**: Uses nested SCSS for organized and maintainable stylesheets.
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts and elements are mobile-friendly and adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Image Asset Handling**: Supports local image imports through the `src` directory.

## Components Included

- **Header**: Navigation bar with dynamic links and title.
- **Banner**: Hero section with title, paragraph, and dual CTA buttons.
- **Gallery**: Image grid display for products or visuals.
- **Footer**: Site-wide footer with external links and copyright.

## Setup & Development

This project uses standard React setup practices. After installing dependencies, you can run the development server locally. Images are stored in the `src/images` directory and imported directly in the component logic.

## Deployment

Once development is complete, the app can be built for production using available build tools in your React setup. The output will be optimized for performance and ready to host.
